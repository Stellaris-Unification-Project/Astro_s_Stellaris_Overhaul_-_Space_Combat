 #NEW WEAPONS
 tech_aso_sc_missile_x_1:0 "Cruise Missiles"
 tech_aso_sc_missile_x_1_desc:0 "Cruise missiles use ultra-long range reactors to reach across entire solar systems, and their extra-large warheads pack a devastating punch."
 tech_aso_sc_missile_x_2:0 "Planck Missile"
 tech_aso_sc_missile_x_2_desc:0 "Building upon the propulsion technology of cruise missiles, planck missiles take advantage of advanced quantum engineering techniques to enhance their destructive payloads."

 tech_aso_sc_strike_craft_4:0 "Shielded Strike Craft"
 tech_aso_sc_strike_craft_4_desc:0 "Innovations in engineering and sensor technologies make previous generations of strike craft obsolete. This generation has further improved astrometrics and weapons systems, and now employs miniaturized shield systems to defend against flak and energy weapons."
 tech_aso_sc_strike_craft_x_1:0 "Heavy Bomber"
 tech_aso_sc_strike_craft_x_1_desc:0 "Heavy Bombers use plasma bombs to destroy hard targets."
 tech_aso_sc_strike_craft_x_2:0 "Phase Bomber"
 tech_aso_sc_strike_craft_x_2_desc:0 "Phase Bombers use advanced dimenstional phasing technology to evade enemy defenses."

 tech_aso_sc_flak_batteries_4:0 "Flak Array"
 tech_aso_sc_flak_batteries_4_desc:0 "Advances in material physics give these weapons more streamlined fire control systems and larger barrels, allowing them to fire larger projectiles that detonate with a greater area of effect and with a higher intensity. The channels of high intensity plasma and molten shrapnel are exceptionally lethal to enemy strike craft."
 tech_aso_sc_flak_batteries_5:0 "Flak Bombard"
 tech_aso_sc_flak_batteries_5_desc:0 "Upgrades to previous generations and innovations in hyper-field physics allow these weapons to move fire control systems into quantum topological manifolds, further increasing the caliber that these weapons can fire. The huge munitions have a massive area of effect, making it nearly impossible for enemy strike craft to dodge incoming flak fire."
 tech_aso_sc_flak_x_1:0 "Flak Cyclone"
 tech_aso_sc_flak_x_1_desc:0 "By tying a flak battery into the ship's spinal mount, we can fire railgun rounds to tear apart enemy small ships with ease."
 tech_aso_sc_flak_x_2:0 "Flak Constellation"
 tech_aso_sc_flak_x_2_desc:0 "By tying a flak battery into the ship's spinal mount and directly to the power core, we can rapidly fire railgun rounds to tear apart enemy small ships with ease."

 tech_aso_sc_pd_tracking_4:0 "Squall Point-Defense"
 tech_aso_sc_pd_tracking_4_desc:0 "Advances in artificial intelligence allow these weapons to utilize micro-sentient AI for vastly improved threat tracking and prediction. The on-board micro-sentient AI is entirely dedicated to the task of generating a firing solution that can repel most offensive munitions."
 tech_aso_sc_pd_tracking_5:0 "Gale Point-Defense"
 tech_aso_sc_pd_tracking_5_desc:0 "Updated munitions systems and advances in matter-energy manipulation allow these weapons to fire munitions with diverted energy warheads. Instead of having complex systems managing multiple munition types each munition can format the energy release upon detonation to do the most damage to each specific incoming threat."
 tech_aso_sc_point_defense_x_1:0 "Tempest Point Defense"
 tech_aso_sc_point_defense_x_1_desc:0 "By tying a point defense array into the ship's central targeting computer, we can fire point defense rounds to tear apart enemy small ships with ease."
 tech_aso_sc_point_defense_x_2:0 "Hellfire Point Defense"
 tech_aso_sc_point_defense_x_2_desc:0 "By tying a flak battery into the ship's central targeting computer and directly to the power core, we can rapidly fire point defense rounds to tear apart enemy small ships with ease."
 
 tech_aso_sc_plasma_4:0 "Plasma Artillery"
 tech_aso_sc_plasma_4_desc:0 "Recent innovations in fluid dynamics allow these weapons to confine exotic plasma in cumulative confinement fields to more efficiently drive plasma projectiles into armor and hull plating.
